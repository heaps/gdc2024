    description : 'The GDC leadership led the global network architecture for the Internet of Things at MIT. The design addresses large-scale computation. Compared to the largest numbers in the world, 2 billion computers, 7 billion phones, and 7 billion people, IOT is orders of magnitude bigger. In similar work, Dr. Sanchez directed simulation of the U.S. critical infrastructure with the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC). Early RFID work included supply chain information engineering, analytics, simulation, and visualization with Wal-Mart, Kraft, and SAP.',
